Project Scenario:
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across 
the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with 
creating a script that can extract the list of the economies of the world in 
descending order of their GDPs in Billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The data is saved in a dataFrame, Database and Json File. They are then queried to return the 
top 10 largest economies """
