## World Economies by GDP (IMF Estimates)  

This repository contains a Python script that automates the extraction, transformation, and loading of country GDP data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as listed on Wikipedia. The data is then stored in both a CSV file and a local SQLite database. Finally, it demonstrates a simple SQL query to extract the top economies with an IMF GDP estimate above 100 billion USD.  


## Project Overview
An international firm is looking to expand its business globally and needs an up-to-date, organized record of the GDP of countries around the world. As a junior Data Engineer, you are responsible for creating a script that fetches the latest GDP data (in billions of USD) from the IMF, processes it, and stores it for further analytics and decision-making.

The script is designed to be run periodically (twice a year or whenever new IMF data is published) so that the data remains current and accurate.

## Data Source
The data is extracted from the archived version of the Wikipedia page: "https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29"  

## Script Workflow  
### 1. Extract  
The script uses pandas.read_html() to read all HTML tables from the Wikipedia page.  
It then selects the relevant table (index 3) which contains the GDP information as per the IMF estimates.  

### 2. Transform
Removes irrelevant rows such as repeated headers and the "World" row.  
Filters out any rows where the GDP data is missing ('â€”').  
Converts the GDP data from millions of USD to billions of USD, rounding to 2 decimal places.  

### 3. Load  
Writes the transformed dataset to a CSV file (Countries_by_GDP.csv).  
Creates a local SQLite database (World_Economies.db) and stores the data in a table (World_Economies).  

### 4. Query
Demonstrates a sample SQL query selecting records for countries with a GDP >= 100 (billion USD).
